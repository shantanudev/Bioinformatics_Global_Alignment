Sample for grading:
Input sequences are going to be mel.txt and psd.txt.
Substitution matrix is subs.txt
Gap penalty: -2.

Result that your code should produce: mel-psd-aln.txt.

To obtain this result:
1. Go to http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/pairwise_align_dna.html
2. Enter the two sequences.
3. Enter match = 2, mismatch = -1, gap = -2.
